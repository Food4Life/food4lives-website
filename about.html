                    Food4Lives is a service family founded by students from Georgia Tech and Emory in 2017 to feed,
                    educate and empower the
                    homeless of Atlanta. Desire Tree Foundation Inc. is an official 501(c)3 non-profit registered with
                    the IRS - Social
                    Charity Work organization. We serve the homeless in 3 simple ways: Annadanam (Feeding the homeless
                    for free),
                    Vastradanam (Providing the homeless basic physical needs and shelter) and Vidyadanam (Educating the
                    homeless for free).

                    In November 2018, we realized that to serve more souls, we would need a large scale permanent
                    facility to carry on these 3 main services as we were growing out of the small rental kitchen and
                    humble distribution equipment that we use to fight the depression of so many hearts. We have finally
                    found a huge kitchen suitable for cooking for 1,000 people at a time. We are looking to raise money
                    to help fund the kitchen rent of $3,782. We humbly appeal to your hearts to be effusive in helping
                    us in this endeavour in any way possible. Whether it is $50/month or $1,000/month, every effort you
                    make to serve the homeless and volunteers will only give you more satisfaction. Every donation you
                    make is tax deductible, but more importantly, makes YOU feel incredible!

                    One year back, in the January of 2017, on a bright yet wintery cold day, a group of 12 students from
                    Georgia Tech
                    and Emory were riding past Hurt Park in Downtown Atlanta. We saw a long line of homeless people
                    waiting to get
                    some food from a charity table. The organizers simply handed out boxes of leftover food from
                    restaurants and the
                    homeless just took what they got and left. The event literally seemed like a transaction - the
                    purpose of doing
                    charity seemed to be simply to get the organizers more social media publicity.

                    <br><br>

                    We decided to stop by and talk to a few of the homeless who collected boxes. Many were wearing
                    clothes that hadn’t
                    been washed in months, and their bodies appeared to be heavily abused by drugs, poor hygiene and the
                    unforgiving
                    weather. When we talked to them and asked them what they thought about people doing charity work,
                    one man’s comment
                    hit us very deeply at heart - “Hey, I just want someone to talk to!”. At the same time, our
                    frustrated hearts,
                    which had been pursuing self-aggrandizement and material success for so long, felt shocked at how
                    deep and satisfied
                    we felt speaking to them. The general operation of most charity work has good intentions, but didn’t
                    seem to be
                    really positively affecting the lives of either the homeless or the volunteers.

                    <br><br>

                    In the spur of the moment, we decided to join hands to solve the problem of homelessness with the
                    real solution -
                    Love. We realized that with economic disparity, there has been an exponential growth of homelessness
                    - but there has
                    also been an increase in frustration and stress levels of people in society. We realized on that
                    day, that in giving
                    our hearts & minds in service to those who seemingly have nothing, we get the most satisfaction.

                    <br><br>

                    On that day, we found an opportunity to be the change that we wanted to see in the world.


                    We decided to form a non-profit whose purpose was to serve the destitute of Greater Atlanta. With
                    the help of wonderful
                    donors and benefactors through time, effort and resources, Desire Tree Foundation Inc. was
                    registered as an official
                    501(c)3 non-profit with the IRS - Social Charity Work organization, with our DBA called Food4Lives.
                    Just as trees
                    selflessly do, we serve the desires of the homeless using 3 simple ways:

                </p>
                <ul
                    style="color: white; text-align: left;font-family: 'montserrat', sans-serif;font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;font-size: 2.5rem;">
                    <li>Annadanam - Feeding the homeless for free</li>
                    - Fed over 30,000 plates of fresh food upto December 2018
                    <li> Vidyadanam - Educating the homeless for free</li>
                    - Collected and distributed 100s of school books and bags for small children, and initiated
                    back to school drives to give them a space in public schools
                    <li>Vastradanam - Providing the homeless basic physical needs and shelter</li>
                    - Provided 1000s of winter clothing, sleeping bags and amenities for warmth
                </ul>

                <br><br>
                <p
                    style="color:white;font-family: 'montserrat', sans-serif;font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;font-size: 2.5rem;">

                    However, each of these activities is done with heart. To give examples:
                </p>
                <ul
                    style="color: white; text-align: left;font-family: 'montserrat', sans-serif;font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;font-size: 2.5rem;">
                    <li> We only serve out food freshly made in a certified kitchen, and that is vegetarian, in
                        packaging and utensils that are reusable. This makes our operation environmentally sustainable
                        and hygienic for the homeless.</li>
                    <li> We ensure that every volunteer takes out time to talk to one homeless person, ask them about
                        the
                        hardships they face and listen without judgement to their heart. We also offer advice to those
                        seeking
                        it on how they can live a better life.</li>
                    <li> We don’t want to just give them items for their bodily sustenance, but to also bring them back
                        into
                        society. We have formed a consortium of wealthy donors who are ready to promote the homeless for
                        simple
                        jobs in labour-intensive industries, while we as students train them on getting over bad habits
                        and
                        turning over a new leaf in terms of both skillset and mindset.</li>
                    <li> Every volunteer is given importance. Volunteers come together outside of volunteering hours
                        just to
                        share our hearts over activities like yoga, nature trips, lunch/dinner etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p
                    style="color:white;font-family: 'montserrat', sans-serif;font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;font-size: 2.5rem;">

                    At present, our family of volunteers is 300 strong and is expanding steadily. Your
                    kind support and motivation has seen us touch the lives of over 5000 homeless souls in
                    downtown Atlanta. Your time, efforts and resources have made all the difference in the
                    lives of both the homeless and our volunteer family.
